# Baling Selipar - A Malaysian traditional game
Baling Selipar is a Malaysian traditional game that requires the use of flip flops.

The game requires two teams which are the  defender and the attacker.

Before the start of the game, the defender will build a pyramid made of three flipflops.

The attacker group will then attempt to destroy the pyramid by throwing a flipflop from a distance.

Once the pyramid is destroyed, the defender group will attempt to rebuild the pyramid.

The attacker must stop the defender group from rebuilding the pyramid by eliminating the

defenders by attacking them with flipflops.

Players will be in the attacking group that are trying to destroy the flip flop pyramid.

The path to victory is only a 'flipflop's throw away.
